The `btclib` folder (https://github.com/dginst/BitcoinBlockchainTechnology/tree/master/btclib) contains Python code, namely Python 3.6 or later with type annotation. Most of the material is instrumental in teaching; algorithms are intended for demonstration and not to be used in production environments: they could be broken using side-channel attacks! Moreover, they will probably have major refactorings without care for backward compatibility.

To install `btclib`:
```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/dginst/BitcoinBlockchainTechnology.git
```

Excel spreadsheets are available in the `excel` folder:
