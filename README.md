## Bitcoin & Blockchain Technology

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dginst/BitcoinBlockchainTechnology.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dginst/BitcoinBlockchainTechnology) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dginst/BitcoinBlockchainTechnology/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/dginst/BitcoinBlockchainTechnology/badge.svg?branch=master)

Python library (and assorted material) originated from the Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology course of Milano Bicocca and Politecnico di Milano Universities.

The `btclib` folder contains Python code, namely Python 3.6 or later with type annotation. Most of the material is instrumental in teaching; algorithms are intended for demonstration and not to be used in production environments: they could be broken using side-channel attacks! Moreover, they will probably have major refactorings without care for backward compatibility.

Excel spreadsheets are available in the GitHub `excel` folder:
